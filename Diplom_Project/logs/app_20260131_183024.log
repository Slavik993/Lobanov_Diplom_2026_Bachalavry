2026-01-31 18:31:05,443 - AppLogger - INFO - Character: Доктор рыцарь, Style: Dark Fantasy, Detailed, Cinematic, Num Scenes: 3
2026-01-31 18:31:13,279 - AppLogger - INFO - Generating frame 1: Doctor Knight, As I was ordered. Scenario episode: In a room with a window, a young man comes out of the room and at the end the knight's doctor appears. But how did this happen? Why is he here? And most importantly, where did this strange object come from (it was hidden inside the window), which kept appearing on the ship and where did it disappear? And then the captain of the ship himself appeared?! But why wasn’t there anything so unusual on the ship?!... To be continued! :)) 

- something that should have been seen :) And I also really like it, of course :) Also, in my opinion, there are cool episodes about vampires, although there is no blood at all, but you can watch... In fact, yes, there are a lot of different ones, cinematic shot, cinematic lighting, dramatic atmosphere, detailed texture, 8k, unreal engine 5 render, ray tracing, natural lighting, high quality, masterpiece, sharp focus, highly detailed, intricate details, photorealistic, professional digital art
