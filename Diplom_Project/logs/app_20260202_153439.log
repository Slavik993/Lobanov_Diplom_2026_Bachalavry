2026-02-02 15:37:48,059 - AppLogger - INFO - Generating frame 1: Bubble sort algorithm, Cybersant, Programmer. Cast: Glyukozin and Askerov. Director's work:
Igor Ivanov (Glyukozin) is a master of programming in C++ languages.
Artyom Kuznetsov is a programmer. Author of the course "Informatics". 

And now again about the game:

Sorting data in Excel allows you to organize and quickly move it into objects. For example, you can generate a list of objects from multiple lists using the SetList() method - it consists of a list of array, number, or element values. You can generate a list of objects from different sources and then send it to a table with specified values. For this you need, establishing shot, diagram, clean white background, simple flat illustration, infographic style, clear lines, minimalist diagram, vector art, high contrast, legible, educational diagram, textbook style, no shadows, no gradients, schematic, explanatory illustration, 4k resolution, simple illustration:1.3, clean background:1.4, high contrast:1.2, legible text:1.3, high quality, masterpiece, sharp focus
