Duration – 1 hour 40 minutes (with a lunch break)
Analysis of the material on the topic “Bucket Sorting Algorithm” is carried out in the format of a lesson-excursion. The teacher's work time is 5 minutes
Methodological recommendations for drawing up an individual training program are divided into three parts: • Basic rules for drawing up an individual program; • Types of learning tasks for group classes (subject blocks); • Approaches to the formation of an individual plan for studying individual aspects of the group’s activities by summarizing methodological recommendations, taking into account the characteristics of the personal educational process;
• Typical tasks for independent mastery of the lesson topic, establishing shot, diagram, technical flowchart diagram, algorithm visualization, programming logic flow, decision diamonds, process rectangles, arrows, data flow, pseudocode blocks, computational steps, software engineering diagram, code structure, logic gates, boolean operations, sorting algorithm steps, array elements, comparison operations, swap operations, loop structures, conditional statements, educational technical diagram, computer science diagram, programming tutorial illustration, clean line art, monochrome technical drawing, precise geometric shapes, labeled flowchart elements, simple illustration:1.3, clean background:1.4, high contrast:1.2, legible text:1.3, technical accuracy:1.4, precise geometry:1.3, professional diagram:1.2, engineering standard:1.2, high quality, masterpiece, sharp focus
