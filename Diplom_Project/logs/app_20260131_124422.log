In short, it was one of the most interesting and spectacular moments of the game. Everything went great! :) But the most important thing is that everything in this game was not very great (as it seemed to me). At first everything went according to the script, but then, against the background of this, the players began to develop some strange feelings, some even wanted to kill the player for stopping them. In fact, everything ended well: I received three stars, and a third was added to my next games. By the way, as it turned out, I myself became the owner of three stars. In general, it’s okay, it’s just that when you occupy the same place with another player, you can already be sure that you will sit there with everyone else, cinematic shot, cinematic lighting, dramatic atmosphere, detailed texture, 8k, unreal engine 5 render, ray tracing, natural lighting, high quality, masterpiece, sharp focus
